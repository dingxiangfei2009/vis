Before showing some demos, start a web server first:
`python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8080`

Make a copy of 'require.js' into 'require.min.js' at the project directory,
then there are some demos available at `localhost:8080/charts/pie.html` and
`localhost:8080/bench.html`.

Chart designs are located in `src/presenter/canvas2d/grapher/ribbon_bar.xml` or embedded directly in the demos.

Enjoy!
